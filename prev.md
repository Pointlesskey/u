TODOs
--------

Add examples
- Map / Object comprehensions
- Module import alias (see golang)
- raise
- Closures
- Universal UTF-8
- Operator precedence with symbols (but prefer function based)

To noodle on
- Complex Numbers
- Global functions
  - Sets operations instead of loops
- Standard library
  - Vector / Matrix operations
- Default arguments
- Functions should use full words, not abbreviations or acronyms.
- Asynchronous / concurrent code
  - Event based programming (when/then) and constraints (unless)
  - channels / coroutines / generators etc
- Safety by observation
- Receiving blocks
- Adjectives as function arguments
- switch/match alias (?)
- main function
